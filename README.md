##Saint Margrethen

Saint Margrethen was initially a basic HTML and CSS project I used to get a better understanding of HTML and CSS concepts about two months into my coding journey. It is a static site currently but with everything I have learnt so far, I Plan to make it responsive with Media queries, improve its file structure and user interface using React and Material UI respectively and make it more accessible using WCAG guidelines this time as I start the project, while it progresses and until I am done.

It is an site for an information Technology company that provides contemporary software developement solutions. 

## Goal

My goal for this project is to move beyond knowing just concepts related to React and get hands-on experience while polishing my skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI and Javascript.

## Tools

The tools I used are:

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|VS code|IDE|
|React|JavaScript framework|
|Bootstrap, Vanilla CSS and Material UI|Styling|
|Git and GitHub|Version control|

## UI Design

The proposed UI design is seen below:
